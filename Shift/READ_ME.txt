This project was a team project

This was built for the 48 hour Global Game Jam in 2014
Made in Unity 2D using C#

The idea of this game is to make it to the goal at the end (to the right) of the level.
The player must overcome obstacles by "shifting" items in the world.
The player will know what they can shift by the exclamation point above their head.
There are only a few levels however levels can be built using the unity editor
by placing the pre-made prefabs onto the scene.
